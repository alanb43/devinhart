"""
The four principles of object oriented programming (OOP):

1. Encapsulation
    * encapsulate data & functions related to said data within "objects"
2. Inheritance
    * allows classes to inherit properties (data) and behaviors (functions) from parent classes 
    * creates a hierarchy of classes which promotes code reuse (addition of housepet to this file was an example of reuse)

3. Polymorphism
    

4. Abstraction
    * when multiple classes share some of the same properties/functionality, you can abstract these things into a shared class from which both "subclasses" inherit

#### Learnings here
# OOP is related to inheritance, what we see here. We're defining a new class called Dog which "inherits"
# the features of an animal while also having features (variables/data) of its own that are specific to
# its needs
class Dog(Animal):
    #self referes to these members
    name: str
    breed: str
    
    # the variables you pass into a function are called "parameters" when you define the signature
    # so __init__ has two string parameters "name" & "breed"
    # but when you actually call the function and pass in real values they're known as "arguments"
    # so if we say Dog("kal", "pitbull") now we have passed in string arguments "kal" & "pitbull"
    def __init__(self, name: str, breed: str, age: int): 
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed
        self.age = age 
        self.is_mammal = True
        self.num_legs = 4
